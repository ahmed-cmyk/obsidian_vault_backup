# **Hierarchy Isn’t Just About Size**

## **1. Don’t Rely Solely on Font Size**

Using font size alone to create visual hierarchy often leads to:

* **Overly large primary content**
* **Unreadably small secondary content**

Instead, distribute hierarchy using a **combination of font weight and color**.

---
## **2. Use Font Weight to Emphasize**

Making important text **bolder** allows you to:

* Keep font sizes more reasonable
* Still convey emphasis effectively

|  **Use Case**  |  **Font Weight**  | 
|---|---|
|  Regular body text  |  400 or 500  |
|  Emphasized text  |  600 or 700  |

> Avoid weights below 400 in UI — they’re too thin for small text and reduce legibility.

---
## **3. Use Color for De-emphasis**

Rather than shrinking text to signal secondary importance, use a softer color.

|  **Content Level**  |  **Suggested Color**  | 
|---|---|
|  Primary  |  Dark (e.g., near-black)  |
|  Secondary  |  Medium gray  |
|  Tertiary  |  Light gray  |

> This approach improves hierarchy **without sacrificing readability**.

---
## **4. Practical Guidelines**

**Color**:

* Stick to 2–3 tones:

  * One dark color for primary content (e.g., article title)
  * One mid-gray for secondary content (e.g., dates)
  * One light gray for tertiary content (e.g., footer notes)

**Font Weight**:

* Use only two:

  * Normal (400–500) for most content
  * Bold (600–700) for emphasis

> If something needs to feel less important, try a **lighter color or slightly smaller size**, not a thin weight.
