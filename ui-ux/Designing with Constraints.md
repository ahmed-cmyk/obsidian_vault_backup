# Designing with Constraints

## 1. Limit Your Choices

Having access to endless colors, fonts, and measurements might sound ideal, but in reality, **too much freedom leads to decision fatigue**.

> The more options you have, the harder it becomes to decide — even for minor things.

**Examples of time-wasting decisions**:

* 12px or 13px font size?
* 10% or 15% box shadow opacity?
* Avatar: 24px or 25px?
* Medium or semibold button text?
* 18px or 20px margin?

When nothing restricts your choices, you end up constantly second-guessing.

## 2. Define Systems in Advance

Instead of picking from an infinite pool each time, **limit your design decisions using predefined values**.

|  **Area**  |  **System Example**  | 
|---|---|
|  Colors  |  Choose 8–10 shades and stick to them  |
|  Typography  |  Use a type scale (e.g., 12px, 14px, 16px, etc.)  |
|  Spacing  |  Predefine margins/paddings (e.g., 8px steps)  |
|  Shadows  |  Use 2–3 standard shadow levels  |

> Make decisions once, not every time. It saves effort long-term and keeps your design consistent.

## 3. Design by Elimination

Working within a limited set of options **makes choosing easier**.

**Example: Choosing icon size** 

* Predefined scale: 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px
* Start with a guess: 16px

* Compare with 12px and 24px

  * If 16px looks best → done
  * If not, pick the better of 12px or 24px and compare it with its neighbors again

> When your options are limited and distinct, the best one becomes obvious.

---
## 4. Systematize Everything

The more systems you define, the faster and more confidently you’ll design.

**Areas worth systematizing**:

* Font sizes
* Font weights
* Line heights
* Colors
* Margins and paddings
* Widths and heights
* Box shadows
* Border radius and width
* Opacity

> You don’t need to systematize everything from the start.

> But **as you design**, look for repeated decisions and turn them into reusable systems.
