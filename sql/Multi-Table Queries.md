# Multi-Table Queries

# Using Joins

Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a *primary key* that identifies that entity *uniquely* across the database.â€¨One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because it is space-efficient), but it can also be a string, a UUID, or a hashed value â€” as long as it is unique.
Using the **JOIN** clause in a query, we can combine row data across two or more tables using this unique key.

### Selecting Columns from Joined Tables

When you use a JOIN in a query, the result is a single combined table that includes columns from all the tables involved in the join.â€¨This means youâ€™re not limited to selecting only columns from the table specified after the FROM keyword â€” you can also select any columns from the joined tables.
**NOTE:** Always qualify columns with their table name (or alias) if the same column name exists in multiple tables.

# Types of Joins
### ðŸ”· Inner Join
The **INNER JOIN** combines rows from two tables where the join condition is satisfied â€” i.e., where thereâ€™s a match in both tables.â€¨
Rows that donâ€™t have a match in either table are excluded.

```sql
SELECT m.column, b.column
FROM movies m
INNER JOIN boxoffice b
  ON m.id = b.movie_id;
```

**NOTE:** You might see INNER JOIN written simply as JOIN. They are equivalent.

### ðŸ”· Left Join
A **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**) returns all rows from the **left table**, and matching rows from the **right table**.â€¨If thereâ€™s no match in the right table, the result will have NULLs for columns from the right table.

```sql
SELECT m.column, b.column
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN boxoffice b
  ON m.id = b.movie_id;
```

Use LEFT JOIN when you want to keep *all rows* from the left table, even if thereâ€™s no corresponding data in the right table.

### ðŸ”· Right Join
A **RIGHT JOIN** (or **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**) is the opposite of LEFT JOIN.â€¨It returns all rows from the **right table**, and matching rows from the **left table**.â€¨If thereâ€™s no match in the left table, the result will have NULLs for columns from the left table.

```sql
SELECT m.column, b.column
FROM movies m
RIGHT JOIN boxoffice b
  ON m.id = b.movie_id;
```

Use RIGHT JOIN when you want to keep *all rows* from the right table, even if unmatched.

### ðŸ”· Full Join
A **FULL JOIN** (or **FULL OUTER JOIN**) returns all rows from **both tables**.â€¨If thereâ€™s no match in one of the tables, the result will have NULLs for the missing side.

```sql
SELECT m.column, b.column
FROM movies m
FULL JOIN boxoffice b
  ON m.id = b.movie_id;
```

Use FULL JOIN when you need to see *all possible rows* from both tables, matched where possible.

# Summary Table of Joins
| **Join Type** | **Includes unmatched rows fromâ€¦** |
|:-:|:-:|
| **INNER JOIN** | Neither table (only matched rows) |
| **LEFT JOIN** | Left table |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Right table |
| **FULL JOIN** | Both tables |

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can remember it like this:
* INNER = Intersection
* LEFT = Left + matches
* RIGHT = Right + matches
* FULL = Union (everything)
