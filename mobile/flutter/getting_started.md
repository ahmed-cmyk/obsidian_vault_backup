# Getting Started with Flutter

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Key Concepts:
- **Dart Language:** Flutter apps are written in Dart, an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language.
- **Widgets:** Everything in Flutter is a widget. Widgets describe how your app view should look given its current configuration and state.
- **Hot Reload:** Instantly see the effects of your code changes without losing the current state of the app.

## Installation:
1.  **Download Flutter SDK:** Get the SDK from the official Flutter website.
2.  **Add to PATH:** Add the `flutter/bin` directory to your system's PATH variable.
3.  **Run `flutter doctor`:** This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It will also suggest tools to install.

## Creating a New Project:
```bash
flutter create my_app
cd my_app
flutter run
```

## Editor Setup:
-   **VS Code:** Install the Flutter and Dart extensions.
-   **Android Studio/IntelliJ:** Install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
