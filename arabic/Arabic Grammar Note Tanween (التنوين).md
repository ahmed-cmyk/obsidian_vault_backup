# Arabic Grammar Note: Tanween (التنوين)

**Tanween** is the double vowel mark at the end of nouns in Arabic. It shows **indefiniteness** (i.e., "a" or "an") and also reflects **the grammatical case** of the noun.

## What is Tanween?

Tanween is simply **nunation** — adding an "n" sound to the end of a word.

There are **three types**:

| Symbol | Name            | Pronunciation | Used When...                      |
|--------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| ـٌ     | **Tanween Damma** | "un"          | Subject of a sentence (nominative) |
| ـً     | **Tanween Fatha** | "an"          | Object of a verb (accusative) or after certain prepositions |
| ـٍ     | **Tanween Kasra** | "in"          | After prepositions like **مِن**, **فِي** (genitive) |

  → After "فِي" → **Tanween Kasra**

- **رَأَيْتُ بَيْتًا** — *I saw a house.*

## Summary

- **Tanween** = "a" or "an" in English.
