# Scope

**Scope** dictates the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects within different parts of your code. JavaScript features three main types of scope:

* **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function or block are globally scoped and accessible from anywhere in the program.
* **Function Scope (Local Scope)**: Variables declared inside a function are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within that function and any nested functions. `var` declarations adhere to function scope.
* **Block Scope**: Introduced with ES6, variables declared with `let` and `const` inside a block (e.g., `if` statements, `for` loops, or simply `{ }`) are block-scoped, accessible only within that specific block.
