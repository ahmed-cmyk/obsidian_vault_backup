# Execution Context

In JavaScript, code runs within an **Execution Context**, an abstract environment that holds crucial information about the current execution. 

**There are two primary types:** 

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**, which is the default environment where code first starts (e.g., `window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
2. **Function Execution Contexts (FECs)**, created each time a function is called, managing its local variables, arguments, and `this` value.
