# Avoid Grey Text on Colored Backgrounds

## **1. Grey Works on White, Not on Color**

Using light grey text to de-emphasize content works well on **white backgrounds** because it **reduces contrast** effectively.

> But this method doesn’t translate well to **colored backgrounds**.

## **2. Why Grey Fails on Color**

* Grey text doesn’t match the hue of the background.
* It creates a **low-contrast, mismatched** look.

* Often appears **dull, faded, or disabled**, especially if:

  * You reduce opacity of white text instead.
  * The background includes **images or patterns** — those will show through the text.

## **3. Better Approach: Hue-Based Adjustments**

Instead of using grey or low-opacity white:

* **Start with a color that shares the same hue as the background.**

* Then adjust:

  * **Saturation**: Reduce to make it feel softer.
  * **Lightness**: Increase or decrease to manage contrast.

> This allows you to reduce contrast **intentionally** without making text look washed out or broken.
