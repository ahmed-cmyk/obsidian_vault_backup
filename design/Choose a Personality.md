# Choose a Personality

Every design conveys a distinct tone or character — and while that might seem vague, even just a few strong, intentional color choices can communicate a lot.

---
## Font Choice

- For a classic or elegant look, you might want to incorporate a serif typeface.
- For a playful look, you could use a rounded sans serif.
- For a plainer look that relies on other elements to provide personality, a neutral serif works best.

---
## Color

- Blue is safe and familiar
- Gold might be “expensive” and "sophisticated"
- Pink is a bit more and not so serious

> Using colors isn’t just about psychology but rather a lot of it is about whether it looks good to you.

---
## Border Radius

- A small border radius is pretty neutral and doesn’t convey much of a personality on its own.
- A large border radius feels more playful.
- No border radius feels a lot more serious and formal.

> Regardless of what you choose it is important to stay consistent because mixing square corners with rounded corners in the same interface always looks worse than sticking with one or the other.

---
## Language

The words you use in an interface can have a massive on the overall personality.

- Using a less personal tone might feel more official or professional.
- Using a friendlier tone with casual langauge makes a site feel friendlier.
