# Starting

## 1. Start with Functionality

* Design **features first**, not layout or branding.
* The app is a **collection of features** — features should dictate navigation and layout, not the other way around.
* Begin with a **real piece of functionality** (e.g., “searching for a flight”) that involves specific inputs and outputs.

> Don’t waste time on typography, shadows, or icons early on.

> Use thick markers or paper to stay focused on layout and flow.

---
## 2. Use Grayscale First

* Avoid color in early design stages.

* Grayscale forces you to rely on:

  * Spacing
  * Contrast
  * Size
  * Hierarchy

> Designing in grayscale results in cleaner, more structured interfaces.

> Add color only after the design works without it.

---
## 3. Don’t Over-Invest in Low-Fidelity

* The purpose of low-fidelity design is to move quickly.
* Wireframes and sketches are **temporary tools**.
* Don’t attempt to design the entire product up front.

> Trying to anticipate every edge case with mockups is ineffective and frustrating.

> Build and test real interactions instead.

---
## 4. Work in Cycles

* Design only the **next small feature**.
* Implement it immediately.
* Fix issues as they appear in the real interface.
* Then move to the next feature.

|  **Good Practice**  |  **Avoid**  | 
|---|---|
|  Short design/build loops  |  Designing everything at once  |
|  Testing in code  |  Overplanning in mockups  |

> Real interfaces reveal real problems.

> Iteration works better than speculation.

---
## **5. Be a Pessimist**

* Don’t imply features you can’t build yet.
* “Nice-to-haves” can delay the entire product.

* It’s safer to:

  * Design and ship the **simplest working version**
  * Add enhancements later

|  **Question**  |  **Consideration**  | 
|---|---|
|  Can we support attachments?  |  If not, leave them out for now  |
|  Should we add X feature?  |  Build only what’s necessary  |

> A working simple version is better than a broken ambitious one.
