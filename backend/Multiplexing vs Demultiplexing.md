# Multiplexing vs Demultiplexing

**Multiplexing** and **Demultiplexing** are core concepts in network communication and backend system design, especially when dealing with multiple simultaneous connections or data streams.

---
## **Multiplexing**

**Multiplexing** is the process of combining multiple signals or data streams into one. It helps reduce the number of physical connections or resources needed.

### **Examples**

* HTTP/2 uses **stream multiplexing** to allow multiple requests/responses over a single TCP connection.
* TCP multiplexes multiple application-level messages over the same socket.
* WebSocket multiplexing: multiple virtual channels over one TCP connection.

### **Why it matters**

* Reduces resource usage (e.g., fewer sockets or threads).
* Improves efficiency, especially over high-latency links.
* Essential in scenarios where system resources (ports, file descriptors, bandwidth) are limited.

## **Demultiplexing**

**Demultiplexing** is the reverse: separating a single combined stream into its original individual messages/signals for delivery to the correct destination or handler.

### **Examples**

* At the OS level: when packets arrive, the transport layer uses port numbers to deliver data to the correct application socket.
* On HTTP/2 clients: demultiplexing allows the browser to match responses to their corresponding requests.
* Message brokers like Kafka demultiplex messages from a topic and deliver them to the right consumer groups.

## **In the Backend**

* Web servers and proxies often **multiplex** HTTP/2 connections for better resource utilization.
* Message queues **demultiplex** messages for appropriate consumers based on topic, header, or routing key.
* Demultiplexing is essential for performance monitoring, logging, or analytics when dealing with merged streams.

## **Connection Pooling**

**Connection pooling** is the practice of reusing a fixed number of open connections rather than creating and closing a connection for every request.

### **How it works**

* A pool is maintained with pre-established open connections (e.g., to a database, Redis, etc.).
* When a request is made, an idle connection from the pool is reused.
* When done, the connection is returned to the pool for reuse.

### **Benefits**

* Reduces latency from TCP handshakes or TLS negotiation.
* Limits resource usage (e.g., number of open connections).
* Helps prevent exhaustion of server-side connection limits (e.g., DB max connections).

### **Example Use Cases**

* **PostgreSQL/MySQL** client libraries often include connection pooling (e.g., pgbouncer, Sequelize).
* HTTP clients like Axios or libraries like node-fetch can reuse keep-alive connections via agents.
* Redis clients pool TCP connections to avoid frequent reconnects.

## **Analogy**

* **Multiplexing**: Putting multiple conversations into one phone call using different voices (channels).
* **Demultiplexing**: Listening to that call and separating each voice into its own recording.
* **Connection Pooling**: Like keeping a few taxi drivers on standby rather than calling a new one for every trip.
