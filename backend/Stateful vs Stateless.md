# **Stateful vs Stateless**

Understanding the difference between **stateful** and **stateless** systems is critical in backend architecture, API design, and distributed systems. This distinction affects scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity.

## **Stateless**

A **stateless** system does **not retain any information** about the previous interactions with a client. Every request is treated independently.

### **Characteristics**

* Each request contains all necessary information.
* No memory of previous requests.
* Simplifies horizontal scaling (easy to add more servers).
* More resilient to failures (no dependency on session memory).

### **Examples**

* **HTTP** is a stateless protocol by default (each request is independent).
* **RESTful APIs** are typically stateless (no sessions).
* **Cloud functions** (e.g. AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) are stateless by design.

### **Pros**

* Easy to scale and cache.
* Failures are easier to handle.
* Lower memory/resource usage per client.

### **Cons**

* Must pass all context with every request (can be repetitive).
* No built-in session handling (external storage needed for things like auth).

## **Stateful**

A **stateful** system does retain context between requests from the same client.

### **Characteristics**

* Server keeps track of client sessions or state in memory or storage.
* Each request depends on prior interaction (e.g. login → then dashboard).
* Requires session persistence (in-memory or DB-based).
* Harder to scale without sticky sessions or shared state.

### **Examples**

* **WebSockets** maintain a persistent stateful connection.
* **FTP** sessions are stateful.
* Traditional login sessions stored in memory or Redis.
* Multiplayer game servers often hold player state in memory.

### **Pros**

* Can reduce the need to resend repeated information.
* Enables rich interactive experiences (e.g. chat, gaming).

### **Cons**

* More complex to scale and maintain.
* Session recovery and fault tolerance are harder.
* Load balancing requires “sticky sessions” or external session storage.

|  **Feature**  |  **Stateless**  |  **Stateful**  | 
|---|---|---|
|  Session Management  |  Not required  |  Required  |
|  Scalability  |  Easier  |  Harder  |
|  Fault Tolerance  |  Higher  |  Lower  |
|  Request Dependency  |  Independent  |  Dependent  |
|  Server Memory Load  |  Low  |  High  |

## **Real World Analogy**

* **Stateless**: Like a vending machine — every transaction is independent. You insert coins, press a button, get your snack. No memory of who you are.
* **Stateful**: Like a waiter — remembers your order, comes back with the food, knows your preferences.

## **Related Concepts**

* **Token-based authentication** (e.g. JWT): Often stateless, since user info is embedded in the token.
* **Session-based authentication**: Typically stateful, with sessions stored on the server.
