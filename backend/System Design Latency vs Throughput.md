# System Design: Latency vs Throughput

**Latency** is the time taken to perform some action or produce some result. Latency is measured in units of time — hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds or clock periods.

> **DEFINITION:** A clock period, also known as cycle time, is the duration of one complete cycle of a repeating clock signal. It represents the time interval between two consecutive rising edges (or falling edges) of the clock waveform. In simpler terms, it's the time it takes for the clock to complete one full "tick". 

**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time. This is measure in units of whatever is being produced per unit of time.

> The term "memory bandwidth" is sometimes used to specify the throughput of memory systems.

Generally you should aim for maximum throughput with minimal latency.
