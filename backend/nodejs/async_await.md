# Async / Await

> **NOTE**: Async/Await is a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion. It's easy to understand and use. 

Adding the keyword `async` before a function ensures that the function returns a promise and the keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns the result.
