# What is NodeJS?

NodeJS is an open-source and cross-platform JS runtime environment. It runs the V8 JS engine, Google Chromeâ€™s core, outside the browser which allows NodeJS to be very performant.

> **NOTE**: NodeJS apps run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

NodeJS provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent NodeJS  from blocking and generally, libraries in NodeJS are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
