# When Do We Not Need Process Isolation in Node.js?

## What is Process Isolation?

Process isolation means running code in **separate processes**, where each has:

* Its own memory and event loop
* Independence from crashes in other processes
* The ability to fully utilize a single CPU core

In Node.js, you achieve process isolation with:

* `cluster` (one process per core)
* `child_process` (spawn separate processes)
* `worker_threads` (lighter, thread-based parallelism)

## Why Use Process Isolation?

Process isolation is useful when:
✅ You need to fully utilize **multiple CPU cores**
✅ You want **fault tolerance** — a crash in one process doesn’t crash others
✅ Your workload is **CPU-bound** (heavy computation)
✅ You’re handling **very high traffic** and need to scale horizontally

---
## When Do You **Not** Need Process Isolation?

You may skip process isolation if:

#### ✅ Your workload is lightweight and **I/O-bound**

Node’s async, event-driven model already handles thousands of concurrent I/O operations (e.g., database queries, file reads/writes) without blocking.

#### ✅ Your app runs fine on **a single CPU core**

On a small server or for low/moderate traffic, a single process can be enough.

#### ✅ You don’t need fault isolation

If occasional crashes or memory leaks are acceptable (e.g., in scripts, internal tools, demos), there’s no strong need to isolate.

#### ✅ You prefer **simplicity**

For smaller apps, simplicity of a single process is often better than managing clusters.

## Summary Table

| Scenario | Use Process Isolation? |
|---|---|
| High traffic & multi-core server | ✅ Yes |
| CPU-intensive workload | ✅ Yes |
| Fault tolerance is critical | ✅ Yes |
| I/O-bound, low-to-medium traffic | ❌ No |
| Single-core server | ❌ No |
| Simplicity preferred over scalability | ❌ No |

---
## Example Use Cases

| Application | Need Isolation? |
|---|---|
| Chat server with thousands of users | ✅ Yes |
| Video transcoding service | ✅ Yes |
| Internal admin dashboard | ❌ No |
| Simple web scraper | ❌ No |

## Notes

* Node.js is single-threaded per process, so it only uses **one CPU core** at a time.
* If your workload is not saturating the CPU, adding process isolation adds unnecessary complexity.
* Always measure your actual performance and bottlenecks before deciding.
