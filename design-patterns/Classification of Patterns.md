# Classification of Patterns

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*. They usually only apply to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are *architectural patterns*. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their *intent*, or purpose. We focus on three main groups of patterns:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
