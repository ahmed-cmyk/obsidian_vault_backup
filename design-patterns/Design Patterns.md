# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## How they differ from algorithms

|              | Algorithm                                                    | Pattern                                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Similarities | Describe typical solutions to some known problems            | Describe typical solutions to some known problems            |
| Differences  | Always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal. | More high-level description of a solution.<br>The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different. |

> **NOTE**: An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.
