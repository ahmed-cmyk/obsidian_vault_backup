# Adding Whitespace

It is difficult to add whitespace because the JSX compiler has trouble distinguishing between grammaticalÂ whitespace, and the whitespace we add for indentation / code readability.

To add an explicit whitespace character:

```jsx
{' '}
```

> **Note**: If you use prettier, it will automatically add whitespace characters for you.
