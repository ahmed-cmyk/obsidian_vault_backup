## General Information about Human Microbiota

- The human microbiota is **super complex** and exists almost everywhere in the body, including every single organ.
- There's a recent suggestion that a microbiome might even exist inside our brains.
- Gut microbes are the **most numerous and influential**, weighing approximately 500g in total, making them the heaviest microbiome in the body.
- They potentially **outnumber actual human cells**, with trillions residing in our guts.
- Every adult has a **unique microbiome**, which is even more unique than a fingerprint; even identical twins raised in the same house have different microbiomes.
- These microbes don't just help digest food; they seem to **physically control many things** inside us without us realizing.

## Recent Discoveries (2024) and Their Effects

### 1. Control of Circadian Rhythm

- A study by Nina Hapner and her team discovered that microbes, even in infants as young as 2 weeks old, have a **24-hour cycle directly correlated to the circadian rhythm**.
- Bacteria in the guts of babies produce metabolites that control various bodily functions on an extremely specific cycle.
- Many of these metabolites influence the brain, affecting sleep, hunger, and other cycles.
- This suggests that bacteria directly control when babies eat, defecate, and sleep, which eventually forms the adult circadian cycle. The exact reasons for this control are currently unknown.

### 2. Connection to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

- A paper by Chiu and her team analyzed fecal samples from 1,600 children, some diagnosed with autism.
- They found **significant differences in the microbiome** (viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, microbio genes, and metabolic pathways) between neurotypical children and children with autism.
- Specifically, they identified **14 archaea, 51 bacteria, 7 fungi, 18 viruses, 27 specific microbio genes, and 12 different metabolic pathways** that were distinct.
- This discovery hints at a direct connection or difference between the microbiome of autistic children compared to neurotypical children.

### 3. Influence on Social Anxiety Disorder

- A separate study by Nathaniel Ritz and his team investigated the link between the microbiome and social anxiety disorder.
- They performed **fecal transplants from healthy individuals and those with social anxiety disorder into germ-free baby mice**.
- Mice receiving microbes from people with anxiety disorder consistently showed a **much higher response to social fear** and displayed anxiety disorder, avoiding other mice.
- These mice **never fully recovered** or became social again, even after changes in diet.
- This suggests a **direct connection between the microbiome and social anxiety disorder**, with certain microbes potentially playing a vital role in developing social fears and other anxiety disorders.
- This finding supports previous studies indicating that gut microbes directly affect stress levels and various anxiety disorders.

### 4. Role in Brain Development and Intelligence

- An extremely recent study suggests that gut microbes potentially **helped humans develop bigger brains and intelligence**.
- Elizabeth Mot and her team studied the primate gut microbiome, comparing three species: squirrel monkeys, macaques, and humans (using mice as subjects for human microbiome comparison).
- The hypothesis was that microbes produce specific molecules and metabolites that directly aid brain development and intelligence.
- **Humans and squirrel monkeys are "brain-prioritizing" species**, meaning their brain size is much larger relative to body weight compared to macaques, whose brains are smaller and whose lifestyle requires more energy for physical activity.
- Brain tissue is metabolically "expensive" and requires significant energy.
- Mice that received poop from **squirrel monkeys** (brain-prioritizing) showed a metabolic shift to **dramatically increase energy use for brain growth** instead of fat storage. They had high triglycerides, low cholesterol, low weight gain, and high glucose levels â€“ all components for growing brain tissue.
- **Similar results were observed with mice receiving human poop**.
- In contrast, mice receiving **macaque poop** showed metabolism geared towards **energy storage**, reducing glucose and increasing fat.
- The conclusion is that gut microbes in species with large brains (like humans) seem to **focus on energy production to feed the brain**.
- This strongly suggests that the **gut microbiome very likely helped humans evolve large brains** and potentially assisted in the development of intelligence in other species where brains play a crucial role.

## Overall Conclusion

- Gut microbes are not just passive inhabitants; they **control us, influence disorders, and might even be responsible for making us smart** by physically assisting the development of intelligence.
- The idea of microbes in our guts acting as "tiny controllers" is a relatively recent and fascinating discovery.
